# Building on Movement with Aptos Templates

## Introduction
Over the past tutorials, we've explored how to write Move contracts and interact with them using the Aptos TypeScript SDK. Now, let's streamline development even further by using **Aptos Templates** to quickly build decentralized applications (dApps) on the **Movement Network**. 

### Why Use Aptos Templates?
Using **create-aptos-dapp**, developers can generate complete end-to-end dApp templates, including both the frontend and smart contract components, with minimal setup. This tool makes it easier to deploy smart contracts, interact with them from a frontend, and follow best development practices.

### Benefits of Using Templates:
- **Faster Development**: Pre-configured templates save time in setting up Move contracts and frontend integration.
- **Best Practices**: Ensures you follow Aptos-recommended structures and design principles.
- **Built-in Move Commands**: Simplifies initializing, compiling, and publishing contracts.
- **Pre-styled UI Components**: Uses **shadcn/ui** and **TailwindCSS** for a professional look.
- **Multiple dApp Types**: Choose from various templates suited for different blockchain use cases.

## Customizing Templates
### Modifying the Theme
- Edit `tailwind.config.js` to modify theme colors and typography.
- Update `frontend/index.css` to change light/dark mode styles.

### Adding Components
Run the following to add UI components using **shadcn-ui**:
```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add component_name
```

### Deploying Your dApp
To publish your project to a live server, ensure your root route is correctly configured. If hosting on GitHub Pages:
- Update the root route in `vite.config.ts`.
